
The Newmark-beta method can be used to solve structural dynamics problems in the time domain, of the form:
M (d^2x/dt^2) + C dx/dt + K x = F 
The following scripts perform this calculation for the case of modal damping.  The scripts use the normal modes to uncouple the system.
mdof_modal_arbit_force_newmark.m is the main script.
The remaining scripts are supporting functions.
